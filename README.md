# Sentiment-Analysis-Climate-Change-UN-Hackathon
Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows us to determine algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”. Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods of natural disasters and climate change action, such that countries can make the appropriate changes to support their climate-related policies and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

We will develop a model that aims to help inform a given country of their current public opinion regarding their respective economical and ecological activity and sentiments associated with it, using tweets regarding climate change. This model will help guide us towards measuring the impact of Climate Change on society as part of monitoring the SDG13 by answering the question: What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the ecological and economical effects of climate change?

Bridging the NLP with empirical approach (correlation between CO2 and GDP emissions) to retrieve insightful recommendations about green investment decisions and policy implications.
