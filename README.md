Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods of natural disasters and climate change action, such that countries can make the appropriate changes to support their climate-related policies and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
